# Simple polyfill for array.find() from ES6

###Shim
A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.

###Polyfill
A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Flattening the API landscape if you will.
Thus, a polyfill is a shim for a browser API. You typically check if a browser supports an API and load a polyfill if it doesnâ€™t. That allows you to use the API in either case.
